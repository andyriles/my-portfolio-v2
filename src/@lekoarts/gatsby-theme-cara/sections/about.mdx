## About

> I am a front-end developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional user interfaces using React.js.

I am currently exploring the world of web development and I am looking for a position where I can utilize my skills and experience to create beautiful and functional user interfaces. I also have a strong interest in blockchain development and I am currently learning about it.

When I'm not pushing pixels, you'll find me playing video games or catching up on the latest movies and tv shows.
